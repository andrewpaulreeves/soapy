The module simulating Deformable Mirrors in Soapy

DMs in Soapy
============
DMs are represented in Soapy by python objects which are initialised at startup
with some configuration parameters given, as well as a list of one or more
WFS objects which can be used to measure an interaction matrix.

Upon creation of an interaction matrix, the object first generations all the
possible independant shapes which the DM may form, known as "influence functions".
Then each influence function is passed to the specified WFS(s) and the response
noted to form an interaction matrix. The interaction matrix may then be used
to forma reconstructor.

During the AO loop, commands corresponding to the required amplitude of each
DM influence function are sent to the :py:meth:`DM.dmFrame` method, which
returns an array representing the DMs shape.

Adding New DMs
==============

New DMs are easy to add into the simulation. At its simplest, the :py:class:`DM`
class is inherited by the new DM class. Only a ``makeIMatShapes` method need be provided, 
which creates the independent influence function the DM can make. The
base class deals with the rest, including making interaction matrices and loop
operation.
